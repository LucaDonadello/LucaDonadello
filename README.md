# Hi there 👋 I am Luca Donadello
I’m a Software Developer with a B.S. in Computer Science from UT Dallas. I focus on building scalable backend systems, optimizing databases, and developing production-ready applications. At Paycom, I worked on mission-critical payroll reporting infrastructure, designing object-oriented PHP systems, optimizing high-volume SQL queries, and improving reliability and compliance for thousands of businesses. I also enjoy building end-to-end projects that blend backend engineering with AI and emerging technologies. Notable work includes AskTube, an AI-powered web application that uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for question answering and summarization over YouTube videos, and VR simulations built with Unity and C#.
